espn_downloader
===============

espn_downloader is a python script for downloading videos from 
watchespn/espn3. 

Note: This is something I made for my own personal use, but perhaps some might 
find it useful.  I've only tested it on my own computer (arch linux).

Thanks to Ksosez/BlueCop for his excellent espn3 xbmc addon, without which
I never would have been able to figure out how to make this work.  


Requirements
------------

* rtmpdump must be installed and in your $PATH

* the script attempts to create/write to ~/.local/share/espn_downloader/
  (can be overridden with --cache-dir option)

* possibly others I've forgotten
